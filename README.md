# Data_cleaning_NAA_grid
This repository contains the Jupyter notebooks of code used to create the datasets, for reference.
Further there is a notebook of how to use the netcdfs to compare observations to the model output on the NAA grid

Best to use the packages Pandas and Xarray for Data-handling. 

## Overview on Datasets
The netcdf's contain a summary of all OBS I was able to find from specific Sources. A detailed summary is in the presentation.
